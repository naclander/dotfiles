T 1377748953 22*	#sagemath :http://www.sagemath.org/
T 1377749009 31<hemite>30	I began using sage and realized how cool it was, until I became disillusioned when I realized it does n't have the "Show steps" feature 
T 1377749025 31<hemite>30	Is there demand for this at all?
T 1377749056 18<Galois>	unclear. Users don't always know what they want until you show it to them.
T 1377749077 18<Galois>	I suspect that researchers who use sage are happy enough with the source code. They can get the steps when required.
T 1377749078 31<hemite>30	Erm, I mean something like what WolphramAlpha has
T 1377749179 31<hemite>30	I havn't even found an open source general step by step solver, so this issue might not be specific to sage
T 1377749211 31<hemite>30	Perhaps the demand isn't really there, although I would personally prefer to use something off the cloud like WolphramAlpha
T 1377749229 18<Galois>	you keep misspelling Wolfram
T 1377749255 31<hemite>30	ok
T 1377749263 18<Galois>	anyway I'm pretty sure WolframAlpha does not show the steps that the compute engine uses to solve the problem. It tries to show the steps that a human would use to solve the problem. The two things are different.
T 1377749292 31<hemite>30	Of course they are, but the latter is obviously what I want
T 1377749321 31<hemite>30	At least for the meantime mathematica has this exact functionality. Too bad its just non-free
T 1377749330 18<Galois>	the latter is hard to do. It would involve much new code, and I think this code would be of little research value. 
T 1377749342 18<Galois>	I am guessing educators would be very interested. I am not primarily a math educator.
T 1377749455 18<Galois>	for researchers, generally speaking, the kinds of steps that you can program are not the kinds of steps that research needs. Research proceeds via new insights. It's hard to program new insights. In fact if you succeeded at such a thing you would be creating artificial intelligence.
T 1377749494 31<hemite>30	It would add little value to researchers I agree, this is an entirely different audience than most computational tools are for at the moment
T 1377749523 18<Galois>	now, this is the part that I don't know. For one, I'm a researcher. But even if I were an educator, it would be hard to say. As I said up front, users do not always know what they want.
T 1377749568 18<Galois>	if you asked whether users wanted a tablet in 2009, most people would have said no. Then Apple showed them the ipad and suddenly everyone realized they wanted one.
T 1377749598 31<hemite>30	I don't really thinks this has to do with "users not knowing what they want" 
T 1377749606 31<hemite>30	I want to know how to solve this problem for class
T 1377749613 31<hemite>30	oh, this cool new tools shows me the steps
T 1377749622 31<hemite>30	This is the type of audience I'm talking about
T 1377749642 31<hemite>30	This is essentially what wolfram (Thanks again buddy) is doing
T 1377749660 18<Galois>	the devil is in the details. As I said, there is a lot of guesswork involved in choosing which steps to show.
T 1377749680 31<hemite>30	The answers that wolfram gives are not always optimal
T 1377749685 31<hemite>30	but they are good enough
T 1377749689 18<Galois>	if you could make it perfectly then I bet everyone would want it. But can you?
T 1377749708 31<hemite>30	naturally its a difficult concept to design and program. But we already know it is possible
T 1377749718 31<hemite>30	But it doesn't have to be perfect
T 1377749722 31<hemite>30	it just needs to be good enough
T 1377749732 31<hemite>30	but before it even is good enough, it needs to exist
T 1377749749 31<hemite>30	which it doesn't, unfortunatley. At least not a FOSS version
T 1377749751 18<Galois>	I'm wary of good enough. Sometimes good enough is counterproductive. It encourages bad habits, over-reliance on tools, and so on.
T 1377749793 31<hemite>30	If over-reliance becomes an issue I'd say we did a pretty good job 
T 1377749854 18<Galois>	I think there is a moral issue. If you make a tool that ends up hurting education and as a result some bad engineers make it through school and build a defective bridge, you haven't really helped anyone.
T 1377749957 31<hemite>30	I think this type of attitude hurts creativity in the long run. Create the tool and let others decide how to use it or if they want to use it. 
T 1377749967 31<hemite>30	Anyway, we've moved past the original issue anyway
T 1377749987 18<Galois>	sure, you're free to make whatever software you want, and SAGE makes it easy for you since it's open source. But SAGE is also a community. Whether the community would support such an effort really depends on the details.
T 1377749995 18<Galois>	You're also free to build your own community.
T 1377750081 31<hemite>30	sure
T 1377750105 18<Galois>	maybe this is my professorial viewpoint showing through, but I don't think students should be asked directly what they want. Students want A's, but I'm not going to give it to them just because they want it.
T 1377750134 31<hemite>30	I think what students want depends on the student
T 1377750149 18<Galois>	for something like this, you should be asking teachers and instructors what they want. And I'm honestly not sure what their answer is.

T 1377751020 18<kini>	wolfram alpha is more than math software
T 1377751039 18<kini>	wolfram alpha can also tell you how many pounds a cubic light year of cheese would weigh
T 1377751066 18<kini>	I don't really see providing the steps of how to solve a problem as being really the function of a computer algebra system
T 1377751083 18<kini>	especially if you're asking for steps that differ from how the program actually computes the answer
T 1377751111 31<hemite>30	It would be an addition to
T 1377751139 31<hemite>30	Regardless of whether that software is defined as CAS, nothing like this exists as FOSS software at all
T 1377751150 18<kini>	true
T 1377751154 18<kini>	someone can feel free to write it
T 1377751172 18<kini>	but I don't really see why it would make sense to integrate it into sage
T 1377751231 18<kini>	[2013-08-28 23:07:43] <Galois> anyway I'm pretty sure WolframAlpha does not show the steps that the compute engine uses to solve the problem. It tries to show the steps that a human would use to solve the problem. The two things are different.
T 1377751232 21<kini>21	[2013-08-28 23:08:13] <hemite> Of course they are, but the latter is obviously what I want
T 1377751241 18<kini>	I don't think that's very obvious
T 1377751252 18<kini>	I mean if you say so, sure
T 1377751257 18<kini>	but it doesn't seem like a very natural thing to implement, to me

T 1377751309 18<kini>	there are some problems - no, many problems - that Sage and other CASes can solve but humans can't (at least not in any reasonably easy way)
T 1377751324 18<kini>	in fact the whole point of a CAS is to expand the range of problems that can be solved
T 1377751338 18<kini>	so I don't see the request as very well-defined in the first place
T 1377751349 19*	19tnguyen (~chatzilla@c-68-35-49-173.hsd1.nm.comcast.net) has joined #sagemath
T 1377751371 18<kini>	the problem of "figure out how a human being would solve this problem" is very different from the problem of "solve this problem"
T 1377751386 31<hemite>30	This request wasn't really *for* sage
T 1377751395 18<kini>	it's not just an "addition" you could tack on to a CAS
T 1377751409 31<hemite>30	it was more of a question anyway. Or a pontification as to why this does not exist
T 1377751420 31<hemite>30	I think we know this would gain traction, again looking at wolfram
T 1377751429 18<kini>	yeah probably
T 1377751433 18<kini>	there are plenty of people who want to use sage for education
T 1377751444 31<hemite>30	Maybe talking to sage users about this is getting biased results, but I think it would be a wondefully useful tool to many people
T 1377751456 18<kini>	I'm not really a sage user
T 1377751472 31<hemite>30	Sage just came to mind first because I equate it to Mathematica, and mathematica has this implemented
T 1377751493 18<mefistofeles>	oh btw, I'm asking again something just in case 
T 1377751510 18<mefistofeles>	I can't create an account in cloud.sagemath.org with firefox and chromium in Linux, any ideas?
T 1377751565 18<kini>	I would ask on the mailing list
T 1377751569 18<Galois>	well I just tried and it worked for me
T 1377751576 18<kini>	sage-cloud on google groups, if I recall correctly
