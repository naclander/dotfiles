T 1371298272 18<rapha>	Hi!
T 1371298315 18<rapha>	Why does LaTeX begin a second page so early with scrlttr2 (after only about two thirds of the first page have been used up) and how do I prevent this?
T 1371298354 18<rapha>	(Instead of beginning the second page with a new word after the first page has been filled, the second page begins with a whole new paragraph)
