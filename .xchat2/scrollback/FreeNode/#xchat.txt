T 1378711239 31<hemite>30	So I like xchat's interface, but I can't run it in a screen session and make it persistent
T 1378711265 31<hemite>30	Or can I? Is there a guide somewhere on setting a bouncer IRC thing or something
T 1378711283 18<TingPing>	use znc
T 1378711319 31<hemite>30	you've had good results with it personaly?
T 1378711329 18<TingPing>	mhm, good stuff
T 1378711341 18<TingPing>	make sure you get 1.0 if you are on an old distro
T 1378711342 31<hemite>30	can you give me a run down of its uses/functionality?
T 1378711381 18<TingPing>	perhaps their site could provide more info than me - http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC
T 1378711394 18<TingPing>	but it just always stays connected and when i wake up i get the messages while i was gone
T 1378711406 31<hemite>30	so xchat connects somehow to znc?
T 1378711412 21<LIP>21	hemite: znc is a bnc which maintains the connection to the irc server, and you connect to that. you can connect to the bnc session from multiple computers if need be, all on the same connection
T 1378711436 18<TingPing>	you connect to it like any other server, yes
T 1378711439 18<LIP>	and XChat connects to the znc session the same way it connects to other IRC servers
T 1378711480 31<hemite>30	so assuming I set up znc, how would I use xchat to connect to it? I don't see any prefrence settings for "proxy" or similiar
T 1378711483 18<LIP>	well, mostly the same, some differences, like any on connect things won't be right when you connect to the overall IRC server, but when you connect to the bnc session
T 1378711533 18<LIP>	you connect directly to it, the address and port of the znc
T 1378711565 18<LIP>	it isn't the same as a socks proxy
T 1378711595 31<hemite>30	Ok, this seems to be the solution I am looking for. I'll look for guides on how to set up this whole system.
T 1378711603 31<hemite>30	It looks a bit complicated
