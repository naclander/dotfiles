T 1375640742 18<pauldachz>	Guest6785: To clarify, there's a legitimate reason LLE's being forced. HLE (or LLE with "DSP on Thread" checked) causes the game to hang at certain points, and people keep running into this and then losing their savefiles because for some reason their memory cards also get corrupted and they've been using savestates the whole damn time.
T 1375640800 18<Guest6785>	i dont use save states that often
