T 1378574293 18<evdw87>	hi there
T 1378574397 18<gh0strider>	so i have ran into an issue that i am hoping someone can point me in the right direction...so i installed the x86 version of mac os x using (iatkos osx) and i installed it with virtualbox. I did this because i wanted to learn about mac before i spend the big bucks and buy a macbook. So i gave the guest os 20GB and that filled up very quickly...
T 1378574417 18<gh0strider>	so i used vboxmanage.exe (win 7 host os) to add 10 gigs to the guest os
T 1378574439 18<gh0strider>	and that worked and virtualbox is showing the iatkos at 30 gigs
T 1378574468 18<NiccosSystem>	evdw87, yes. But on Windows 7
T 1378574482 18<evdw87>	NiccosSystem: should work on windows 8 aswell
T 1378574494 18<NiccosSystem>	When I try to install it on Win8, it gives me this message: "This app can't be installed on your computer"
T 1378574495 18<evdw87>	what errors do you run into?
T 1378574496 18<gh0strider>	but when i boot into iAtkos (mac os x) it is still only showing the 20gigs...just guessing but do i need to repartition to get the x86 version of mac os x to use the full 30 gigs?
T 1378574500 18<S_SubZero>	gh0strider: there's no support for that here.

T 1378574637 18<gh0strider>	okay...i was just hoping that maybe someone in here had run into this situation and maybe knew a way to fix it....

T 1378575436 18<doubletwist>	That's fair. And makes sense to me. At least as far as learning how the interface and workflow are. Obviously won't get the feel for how the macbook is physically.
T 1378575474 18<doubletwist>	As it is, I sold my mac mini after a few months and went back to Linux. OSX was great in some ways but for the way I like to work, the interface fell short for me.
