T 1384675676 18<avocado>	[23:54:59] there are LOTS of people using github for all the right reasons
T 1384675676 18<baumy>	[23:55:11] my main positive experiences on github come from people developing vim plugins
T 1384675676 18<avocado>	[23:55:32] github does a lot of things very well, and github itself is not the problem
T 1384675676 18<avocado>	[23:55:43] it's just one of the cultural side effects
T 1384675676 18<avocado>	[23:55:56] where you'd be better off having two github profiles

T 1384675676 18<baumy>	[23:57:01] i think the problem lies with people who feel self conscious posting anything that isn't beautiful, and companies who would look at somebody rolling in the mud with weird code and judge them

T 1384675676 18<sankey>	[23:58:11] avocado: just because git is labeled a distributed protocol doesn't make github a decentralized service
T 1384675676 18<avocado>	[23:58:30] sankey: why does github need to be "decentralized"?
T 1384675676 18<baumy>	[23:58:34] so youd rather there be a lot of different sites that offer the same service as github?
T 1384675676 18<avocado>	[23:59:13] sankey: you do realize, you can easily make your own git hosting service with almost all the features and maybe more than github
T 1384675676 18<baumy>	[23:59:16] its easy enough to host it on your own server
T 1384675676 18<avocado>	[23:59:20] gitorious does it pretty well

T 1384675676 18<sankey>	[23:59:44] it's just interesting to think about ways to federate github features
T 1384675676 18<sankey>	[00:00:20] and seamlessly partition github into multiple entities that don't rely on each other

T 1384675676 18<baumy>	[00:02:00] i could probably do it with 4 or 5 clicks
T 1384675676 18<avocado>	[00:02:01] well it's easy to clone anyone's github
T 1384675676 18<baumy>	[00:02:15] it sounds like youre tearing down one convenience in favor of another
T 1384675676 18<baumy>	[00:03:19] which just as easily could be added if github implemented some way to clone some remotely hosted repo and pull/push from/to it

T 1384675676 18<avocado>	[00:03:54] that's not really their job to do that, either

T 1384675676 18<avocado>	[00:04:15] they take a git repo, they make it look pretty, and they let people make comments that they store for others to see

T 1384675676 18<sankey>	[00:05:04] well, and it provides a wiki for each proejct

T 1384676128 18<avocado>	sankey: and you're telling me those projects will suffer crippling, catastrophic, project ending losses if they lose them?
T 1384676146 18<baumy>	does something have to be that bad in order to try to deal with it?
T 1384676152 31<hemite>30	openmw has its own server for redmine
T 1384676160 18<baumy>	thats fantastic for openmw
T 1384676168 31<hemite>30	but it uses github to host the code/ commit tracking
T 1384676172 18<sankey>	avocado: i think you have too much of a project-by-project perspective
T 1384676178 18<sankey>	i'm talking what if github goes down
T 1384676226 18<sankey>	say all projects, on average would be set back by 10%
T 1384676235 18<sankey>	that's huge
T 1384676254 18<avocado>	how many of those projects will cease to be able to continue development?
T 1384676263 18<sankey>	a very small percentage
T 1384676271 18<sankey>	but that's not the point
T 1384676273 18<baumy>	avocado: i think youre hammering too hard on that
T 1384676287 18<baumy>	just because a setback doesnt kill a project dead, doesnt mean it isnt serious and shouldn't be avoided if possible
T 1384676303 18<avocado>	baumy: sankey, you're talking about github going completely AWOL from the internet and never returning. so, assuming that is the world we live in, i think my point is pretty reasonable.
T 1384676323 18<avocado>	people will manage just fine going somewhere else
T 1384676330 18<baumy>	fair
T 1384676360 18<avocado>	but they will have the SAME problem anywhere else they go to host whatever it is they find they want hosted
T 1384676371 18<baumy>	unless they host it themselves
T 1384676382 18<avocado>	in which case, they'll probably have a worse time at it
T 1384676383 18<baumy>	which is impractical for a lot of projects obv
T 1384676390 18<baumy>	true
T 1384676400 18<avocado>	now, yes, it's good to have a backup of your issues
T 1384676409 18<avocado>	but that's why so many bug trackers are integrated with email
T 1384676421 18<avocado>	so even if the tracker goes kaput, everyone still has their emails
T 1384676426 18<baumy>	actually i forgot about that
T 1384676437 18<baumy>	project owners should have a complete email backup of issue threads
T 1384676442 18<baumy>	unless they delete their emails but who does that
T 1384676466 18<avocado>	so, yes, i do understand wanting to offload some of the responsibility that github takes by doing FULL project hosting
T 1384676472 18<avocado>	but it's not something i would get up in arms about
T 1384676477 18<avocado>	there are much better fights to pick
T 1384676488 18<avocado>	for isntance, fuck canonical
T 1384676529 18<baumy>	good thread guys
T 1384676532 18<sankey>	we should make bzrhub

T 1384676726 18<baumy>	ive heard people make that point in seriousness
T 1384676753 18<baumy>	ive forgotten how terrible r/programming is

T 1384677210 18<baumy>	do you even do anything?
T 1384677213 18<avocado>	but all the mods below me want to institute "minimum requirements" to stay a mod

T 1384677412 18<avocado>	yea and you get like 2 or 3 extra features
T 1384677425 18<baumy>	ok then explain this to me
T 1384677431 18<baumy>	somebody makes a witty or insightful or stupid comment
T 1384677437 18<baumy>	and someone else buys them reddit gold
T 1384677437 18<avocado>	like 500 comments per page, highlights new comments, and that's about all i know
T 1384677443 18<baumy>	why would you donate to reddit in recognition of somebodys comment?
T 1384677453 18<baumy>	why not just give that person money

T 1384677547 18<baumy>	im disappointed that you keep the points for comments after you delete them

T 1384677561 18<baumy>	i tend to delete all my comments about a few weeks after i make them
T 1384677572 18<baumy>	because i want to have conversations sometimes, but generally dont want people to be able to read things ive said in the past

T 1384677596 18<avocado>	after about 2005, i've decided i hated "chatting" on forums

T 1384677684 18<baumy>	agreed
T 1384677691 18<avocado>	and often times, i have no purpose
