T 1389321338 18<aberrant>	so -architectural question for you guys. You have to keep track of source and destination ip addresses, and keep counters for two values associated with traffic from a src to a dst. The counters are incremented using an event loop (libevent) so normal hashing won't work very well. How do you do this?

T 1389321455 18<aberrant>	Zhivago: when you add an element to a hash, you have to figure out first whether the key is already there. The problem is that given the asynchronous event loop, you might have two checks happening at the same time, which means you'll get two "this is a new key" results, which is problematic.
