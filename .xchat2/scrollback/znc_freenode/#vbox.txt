T 1379718970 18<bekks>	nonconvergent: Well. You are not using the official vbox build. Uninstall the vbox package, and install the latest official vbox release from the official website.
T 1379719060 31<hemite>30	bekks, Is that the auto resize guest display option? host + g ?

T 1379719131 31<hemite>30	that's already enabled and its still happening
T 1379719149 31<hemite>30	its just a small centered box when I set it to full screen
T 1379719163 18<bekks>	Then reinstall the guest additions.
T 1379719164 18<nonconvergent>	bekks: It's the official Debian backport for Debian Stable.
T 1379719188 18<bekks>	nonconvergent: The please proceed to the debian support. In here, only official packages are supported.
T 1379719214 31<hemite>30	bekks, I've already reinstalled several times
T 1379719223 21<bekks>21	hemite: Which guest OS?
T 1379719224 31<hemite>30	That's why I'm thinking its a windows 8.1 compatability problem
T 1379719232 31<hemite>30	Windows 8.1, as I've said above
T 1379719238 21<bekks>21	hemite: Which vbox version?
T 1379719257 31<hemite>30	4.2.18
T 1379719267 31<hemite>30	matching the guest additions
T 1379719310 18<bekks>	Did you uninstall the guest additions, reboot your guest to safe mode, install the guest additions again, using the WDDM driver, and reboot the guest to normal mode again?
T 1379719320 18<bekks>	Shutdown the guest first, and take a snapshot.
T 1379719433 31<hemite>30	No I havn't done that, what's the WDDM driver?
T 1379719459 18<nonconvergent>	by supported, you mean a group of mostly users answering questions. I'm not saying it's a bad position to take; I've taken it myself on Debian support.  But implication that it's a bug related to an unknown factor attributed to something the Debian maintainer did when he built vbox and guest additions from the source is not nearly as useful as a simple "I don't know."
T 1379719477 18<bekks>	The driver following the "Windows Device Driver Model".
T 1379719487 18<bekks>	Experimental, though.
T 1379719495 18<bekks>	Thats why you should take a snapshot before.

T 1379719635 31<hemite>30	bekks, Windows 8 doesn't have a traditional "safe mode". Additionally I do not see any posts online describing to do this
T 1379719648 31<hemite>30	I just wanted confirmation of someone getting this working, or not getting it working
