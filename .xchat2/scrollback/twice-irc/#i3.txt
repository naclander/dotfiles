T 1378761054 18<crypticmofo>	dam that sucks
T 1378761065 18<gustav>	your keyboard need to be able to use capslock as a normal key, which is supposedly are not
T 1378761137 18<crypticmofo>	well how about this .. i want to remap the alt key to mod
T 1378761140 18<crypticmofo>	how about that ?
T 1378761156 18<gustav>	take a look at the keyboard options pane we looked at before
T 1378761165 18<gustav>	most of the common mapping are available there
T 1378761184 18<gustav>	it should be possible, as they have the same functionality
T 1378761248 18<crypticmofo>	yea cuase right now im using weechat-curses
T 1378761265 18<crypticmofo>	it relies on alt key for stuff .. i really don't need it i can just /buffer <whatever number>
T 1378761280 18<gustav>	you could remap the win/super key to alt then
T 1378761281 18<crypticmofo>	so i want to put alt as mod and my windows key realy for nothing
T 1378761320 18<gustav>	if it's not possible with the options in the gnome-control-center it should be possible to google a solution
T 1378761430 18<crypticmofo>	gustav: remember when you first start i3 you can map from window or alt
T 1378761434 18<crypticmofo>	its probably in there somewhere
T 1378761445 18<gustav>	oh, thats the line you mentioned earlier
T 1378761476 18<gustav>	super is mod4 and alt is mod1 iirc
T 1378761481 18<crypticmofo>	aw
T 1378761483 18<crypticmofo>	so just change that

T 1378761549 18<vandannen1>	gustav: your script crashes in the case of an empty workspace as no window is focused, and thus line 45 fails
T 1378761583 18<crypticmofo>	yea alt = mod1
T 1378761602 18<gustav>	vandannen1: damn, good catch. Should have seen that myself
